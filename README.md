# Implementing Decision Trees Algorithm from Scratch

Welcome to the Introduction to Machine Learning module coursework repository!

This project is an implementation of a decision tree algorithm, tested on determining indoor locations based on WiFi signal strengths collected from a mobile phone. Please note that for this coursework, only Numpy and Matplotlib were available, no built-in implementation or additional frameworks were used.

In this project, you will find:
  - The source code for the decision tree algorithm, including any necessary dependencies and instructions for running the code.
  - A description of the data loading process and how the decision tree algorithm was implemented based on pseudocode from "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.
  - Implementation of cross-validation, confusion matrices, train-test splitting, in order to analyse the results on the wifi dataset for the report.  
  - Implementation of a pruning function to reduce the validation error from overfitting to training data. 
  - Final report, attaining a near perfect score!

Running Code Instructions:
  - Ensure 'wifi_db' is saved in the same local directory as the Python notebook. 
  - Code cell that loads the data is clearly labelled and provides instructions on how to load an unseen dataset. 
  - Notebook cells must simply be run top-down - each section is labelled with a markdown.

I hope that this project will serve as a useful reference for those interested in implementing decision tree algorithms for classification tasks. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out
