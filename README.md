# Introduction to Machine Learning Coursework 1

Running the code on the lab machines simply requires that the datasets 'clean_data.txt' and 'noisy_data_txt' are saved in the directory 'wifi_db', and  'wifi_db' is saved in the same local directory as the Python notebook. The code cell that loads the datasets (Step 1: Loading Data) is clearly labelled and provides instructions on how to load an unseen dataset. To test the code, the notebook cells must simply be run top-down; each section is labelled with a markdown. The markdown also includes a brief description of the contents of each section. The intention is for the notebook to be coherent and organised enough that no supplementing instructions are required to navigate the notebook.
